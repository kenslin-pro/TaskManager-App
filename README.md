# Task Manager in Kotlin

## Overview

As a software engineer seeking to enhance my skills, I developed a console-based Task Manager application in Kotlin. This project serves as a practical demonstration of my understanding of Kotlin's syntax and my ability to create a functional software solution.

## Software Description

The Task Manager is a console application that allows users to add, remove, and list tasks. Written in Kotlin, the program provides a simple yet effective demonstration of basic command-line interaction and data management.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to strengthen my proficiency in Kotlin programming. By creating a practical application, I aimed to apply key language concepts and gain hands-on experience in building a functional software solution from scratch.

## Software Demo

Check out the [Software Demo Video](http://youtube.link.goes.here) for a 4-5 minute walkthrough of the Task Manager application. The video focuses on the software running in action and provides insights into the code structure and Kotlin language features.

## Development Environment

- **Kotlin:** Version X.X.X
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA (or any other Kotlin-compatible IDE)
- **Build Tool:** Gradle (optional)
- **Version Control:** Git

## Useful Websites

During the development process, I found the following websites helpful:

- [Kotlin Official Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - A valuable resource for troubleshooting and problem-solving in Kotlin.

## Future Work

While the current version of the Task Manager meets basic requirements, there are several areas for future improvement:

- Enhance input validation for user entries.
- Implement persistence to save tasks between sessions.
- Add support for task priorities and due dates.

Feel free to contribute or provide feedback to help improve the project!
